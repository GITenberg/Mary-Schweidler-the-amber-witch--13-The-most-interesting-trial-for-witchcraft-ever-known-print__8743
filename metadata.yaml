description: "The Amber Witch is a German novel published by Wilhelm Meinhold (1797â€“1851)\
  \ in 1838. Its German title is Maria Schweidler, die Bernsteinhexe. The novel was\
  \ originally published as a literary hoax which purported to be an actual 17th-century\
  \ chronicle. Meinhold later admitted to the hoax but had some difficulty in proving\
  \ that he was its author. In 1844, it was published in Britain as The Amber Witch\
  \ in two English translations: one by E. A. Friedlander and another, more enduring,\
  \ translation by Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon.\nLady Duff Gordon's translation was very\
  \ popular with the Victorians and went through numerous editions, including a luxurious\
  \ one in 1895 illustrated by Philip Burne-Jones. The novel was a favourite of Oscar\
  \ Wilde's when he was a boy, and in 1861 it was made into an opera, The Amber Witch,\
  \ composed by William Vincent Wallace. Wallace's opera has faded into obscurity,\
  \ but the novel on which it was based has continued to be republished, both on its\
  \ own and in anthologies.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
